# Class-Spatial-Analysis-
R tutorials of the class spatial analysis  

Presentation of the class
Spatial analyses are statistical analysis that seeks to explain spatial data patterns in mathematical 
and geometric terms. Spatial modelling are the statistical techniques to approximate reality and make 
spatial predictions. Environmental data is any information that can be used to solve an environmental 
issue, including data on economics, society, biodiversity, climate, hydrology, biophysics, etc. The main 
objective of this course thus is to introduce grad students to the spatial analysis and modelling of 
environmental data using open-source software (R and Google Earth Engine-GEE). The course is divided
in twelve modules where students develop spatial analyses on several environmental issues using real 
data (available for public use) and R codes mainly. Although the material of the course is in English 
(tutorials, books, data), the classes are going to be teach in Spanish.
